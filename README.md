- Introduction to association in gorm


##  :beginner: About
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source, compiled, and statically typed programming language designed by Google. 
It is built to be simple, high-performing, readable, and efficient.
Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Golang (Go). Gin has a martini-like API and claims to be up to 40 times faster.
Gin allows you to build web applications and microservices in Go. It contains a set of commonly used functionalities (e.g., routing, middleware support, rendering, etc.) that reduce boilerplate code and make it simpler to build web applications.
The GORM is fantastic ORM library for Golang, aims to be developer friendly. It is an ORM library for dealing with relational databases. This gorm library is developed on the top of database/sql package.


## :zap: Usage
- Concurrency thrives in any networking environment. Using goroutines and channels, Go is naturally suited for developing network services such as APIs, web servers, and mini frameworks for web applications. 
- The same concurrency and networking features align with its high portability across various platforms make Go an exceptional language for cloud computing. As a matter of fact, many stand-out cloud platforms like Kubernetes were built with Go. Google Cloud also uses Go to enhance scalability and performance. 
- Many old infrastructures were rewritten using Go in an attempt to modernize what’s become obsolete over time. A new version of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) – an internet protocol for clock synchronization among networks – relies on Go. 
- Since Go is fully functional with little to no dependencies, the language is well-suited for building small tooling items. These can launch quickly and be packaged for redistribution at a moment’s notice. 
- The busy bustle of everyday life requires technology that can accommodate the everyday person who needs fast and reliable service. The best example of a service like this is Uber which uses Go to get to users in the nick of time for just about every request. 

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- Download the Golang according to your system architecture from https://golang.org/dl/
- After downloading, unzip the downloaded archive file. After unzipping you will get a folder named go in the current directory.
- Now copy and paste the extracted folder wherever you want to install this.
- Open environment variables and then
- Click on Path from the system variables and then click Edit. Then Click New and then add the Path with bin directory where you have pasted the Go folder.
- Open terminal and type "go --version" to check if it is correctly installed.
- in the integrated terminal type 'go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin'
- in the integrated terminal type 'go get “github.com/jinzhu/gorm' or 'go get gorm.io/gorm'
- for sql driver 'go get gorm.io/driver/mysql'
